# Soccer Stars: Multiplayer Game Using Socket Programming

## Overview

**Soccer Stars** is an exciting multiplayer soccer game that utilizes socket programming for real-time communication between clients and a server. The game simulates a competitive soccer match where players can control their teams and compete against each other in a virtual soccer arena.

This project is built using Python and socket programming, where one player acts as the host (server) and others connect as clients. The server handles game logic, player interactions, and synchronizing the game state across all connected clients.

## Features

- **Multiplayer support**: Multiple players can join the game and compete in real-time.
- **Socket communication**: Efficient communication between clients and server using Python's `socket` module.
- **Game mechanics**: Control the movement of players, soccer ball, and score goals to win.
- **Real-time synchronization**: All game actions are synchronized across all connected players in real time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `socket` library (included with Python)
- Any modern web browser for playing (if using a web interface) or game client (if applicable)

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soccer-stars.git
    cd soccer-stars
    ```

2. **Run the server:**

    First, start the server to host the game.

    ```bash
    g++ server.cpp Game.cpp Player.cpp Logger.cpp  -o server
    ```

3. **Run the client:**

    After starting the server, players can run the client on their respective machines to connect to the game.

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

4. **Start playing:**

    After all players have connected, the game will start. Players can control their teams and aim to score goals against their opponents.

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: The goal of the game is to score more goals than the opponent within the time limit.
- **Controls**: Players can control their in-game characters using the keyboard. The controls may vary depending on the client implementation.
- **Game modes**: The game can support single matches, or you can add tournament-style gameplay.

## Socket Communication

- The game uses a client-server architecture where the server manages the game state and coordinates communication between clients.
- Each client sends input commands (e.g., move player, kick ball) to the server, which processes these commands and broadcasts the updated game state to all connected clients.
- The server ensures that the game is synchronized across all players.

## Code Structure

- `server`: The main server script that listens for incoming client connections, processes game logic, and broadcasts game state.
- `client.py`: The client script that connects to the server, sends user inputs, and displays the game state.

## Future Improvements

- **AI opponents**: Implement computer-controlled players for single-player mode.
- **Graphics**: Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Pygame.
- **Matchmaking**: Implement a matchmaking system to pair players based on skill level.
- **Chat feature**: Allow players to communicate with each other during the match.
